  <h7> We are a group of 5 students, currently studying at SCTR's PICT,Pune.
  Each of us are passionate about making a project that will change the world.
  No Food Waste,feed the needy is an organisation which aims to redistribute excess food from weddings, parties, 
  events to those who are hungry.
  We aim to bring benefits across the spectrum of society and help provide access to food to those who donâ€™t have
